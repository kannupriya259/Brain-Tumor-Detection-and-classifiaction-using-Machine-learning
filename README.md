# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-classifiaction-using-Machine-learning
Overview:
This project aims to detect and classify brain tumors in medical images using machine learning techniques. Brain tumors are a critical health issue, and early detection plays a pivotal role in effective treatment. By leveraging machine learning algorithms on medical imaging data, this project endeavors to assist healthcare professionals in accurately identifying and categorizing brain tumors.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset consists of MRI or CT scan images that undergo preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and noise reduction to prepare them for model training.
Model Development: Various machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and others are implemented to classify brain tumor images.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to assess the models' effectiveness.
Visualization: Visual representations, such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and heatmaps, illustrate model performance and aid in understanding classification results.
